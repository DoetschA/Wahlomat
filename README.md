Some statistics on pre-election questionaires to german parties before federal and regional elections

I have tried to make parties comparable on a data-driven level.
Data for particular elections were obtained from www.wahl-o-mat.de and consist of parties' answers to selected questions prepared by the wahl-o-mat team to query their positions on specific political topics that are relevant for the upcoming election.
The analysis consists of an NMDS performed on the (Manhattan) distannces between parties' Vector of answers (either -1, 0 or 1 for 'disagree', 'neutral and 'agree', respsectively).
